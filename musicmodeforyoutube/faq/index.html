            <p>
              Music Mode for YouTube™ used to completely block the video and play only the audio on YouTube, YouTube
              Music, and YouTube for mobile. However, due to recent changes made by YouTube, it’s no longer possible to
              block the video on YouTube. The good news is that the video blocking feature still works on YouTube Music
              and YouTube for mobile, so you can continue enjoying the full experience there. On YouTube, the extension
              now hides the video instead of blocking it.
            </p>
            <h3>Why doesn’t it work on YouTube anymore?</h3>
            <p>
              In July 2024, we observed that YouTube made technical changes to how videos are delivered. Previously,
              audio and video were served as separate files, allowing the extension to block the video while keeping
              only the audio. Now, both audio and video seem to be combined into a single file, making it impossible (?)
              to block the video separately.
            </p>
            <h3>Will this be fixed?</h3>
            <p>
              As of now, I haven’t found a workaround to bypass these changes, so there’s no specific plan to fix this
              issue.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
              The extension still works perfectly on YouTube Music and YouTube for mobile, helping you save data by
              blocking the video. On YouTube, while the video isn’t blocked, it’s hidden, and all other features of the
              extension remain fully functional.

            <h2>The extension is detected as an ad blocker by YouTube. What can I do?</h2>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              YouTube has started detecting ad blockers and restricting access for users who have them enabled. Since
              Music Mode for YouTube™ includes an option to skip and block ads, some users may experience this issue and
              be prevented from using YouTube.
            </p>
            <h3>What’s the solution?</h3>
            <p>If you encounter this problem, there’s a simple workaround:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Open the extension’s options.</li>
              <li>
                Disable the "Ad Skipper" option for YouTube or YouTube Music, depending on where the issue occurs.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              If you prefer to avoid ads altogether, I recommend using a trusted ad blocker that has successfully
              bypassed YouTube’s restrictions and works for you.
            </p>
            <h3>Will this be fixed?</h3>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to reproduce this issue on my own devices, as YouTube hasn’t blocked me
              from using the extension with the Ad Skipper enabled. Without being able to replicate the issue, finding a
              solution is challenging. However, I plan to seek help from community forums and explore possible fixes.
              While I’m working on this, I can’t promise any immediate resolution.
