# ps-info-template

Case Study you can use as a template to create a web-based dialog system that covers the information stage of a public service. This system includes two main elements, a questionnaire and a number of questions (with their answers) that are frequently asked by citizens about this service, known as FAQs. It was created in order to inform citizens whether or not they are eligible for the public service and to provide information on the documents required.

You can visit the web-based dialogue system [here](https://govgr-mobility-card.github.io/info-for-mobility-card-gr/).

To deploy your site to GitHub Pages, follow these steps: 

1.Make the repository public (unless you have a GitHub Pro account, which allows private repositories to be deployed).

2.Go to the repository's settings:
- Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
- Click on the "Settings" tab at the top of the repository page.

3.Select "Pages" from the menu:
- On the left-hand side of the settings page, find and click on "Pages".

4.Configure the deployment source:
- In the "Source" section, select "Deploy from a branch".
- Choose the branch you want to deploy. It is recommended to merge all your branches into the main branch and deploy from there for simplicity and consistency.

Here’s a visual guide to the steps:

After successfully completing the previous steps, wait a few seconds and refresh the page. You should see the deployment URL at the topp of the Page (green box in the screenshot).
